# GateKeep

GateKeep is a Telegram mini-app designed to empower Web3 protocols, DAOs, and other communities by creating active, verified, and engaged groups. By implementing controlled gatekeeping mechanisms, it ensures that only users meeting specific criteria can join and participate in groups. Additionally, it provides discovery features to help users explore similar groups or events based on analytics.

## 🚀 Features

### Gatekeeping Mechanisms
- **POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol)**: Restrict access to users who possess specific POAPs, ensuring only relevant participants.
- **Transaction-Based Controls**: Set minimum transaction criteria for entry, ensuring participants are active blockchain users.
- **Token-Based Requirements**: Require users to hold a minimum amount of specific tokens, creating value alignment.

### User Discovery
- **Group and Event Recommendations**: Help users discover other groups or events hosted by the same or similar protocols.
- **Analytics-Driven Suggestions**: Recommend groups based on participation patterns and interests.

### Community Benefits
- **Verified Users**: Ensure that members meet predefined criteria for engagement, creating a more meaningful group experience.
- **Higher Engagement**: Attract participants who are more likely to contribute and respond actively.
- **Cross-Community Awareness**: Promote awareness of related communities and events.
